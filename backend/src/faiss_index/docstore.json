The module \nsystem lets you load external libraries into your application. That’ll enable you to take \nadvantage of built-in Node.js modules as well as third-party npm modules. This includes \nlibraries for connecting to database, creating web servers, and more! \nLesson 2: Importing Node.js Core Modules \nNode.js comes with dozens of built-in modules. These built-in modules, sometimes \nreferred to as core modules, give you access to tools for working with the file system, \nmaking http requests, creating web servers, and more! In this lesson, you’ll learn how to \nload in those core modules and use them in your code. \nImporting Node.js Core Modules \nTo get started, let’s work with some built-in Node.js modules. These are modules that \ncome with Node, so there’s no need to install them.","metadata":{"_id":"68ae1699bb00e5fd2c951775","source":"api"}}],["481af666-313b-41c1-8e8b-1b9b88befb11",{"pageContent":"Importing Node.js Core Modules \nTo get started, let’s work with some built-in Node.js modules. These are modules that \ncome with Node, so there’s no need to install them. \nThe module system is built around the require function. This function is used to load in a \nmodule and get access to its contents. require is a global variable provided to all your \nNode.js scripts, so you can use it anywhere you like! \nLet’s look at an example. \nconst fs = require('fs') \n  \nfs.writeFileSync('notes.txt', 'I live in Philadelphia') \nThe script above uses require to load in the fs module. This is a built-in Node.js module \nthat provides functions you can use to manipulate the file system. The script uses \nwriteFileSync to write a message to notes.txt. \nAfter you run the script, you’ll notice a new notes.txt file in your directory. Open it up and \nyou’ll see, “I live in Philadelphia!”. \nLinks \n• Node.js documentation","metadata":{"_id":"68ae1699bb00e5fd2c951775","source":"api"}}],["e3905b97-50df-4eac-ad37-bdaeff4ff086",{"pageContent":"Version 1.0 \n11 \n• Node.js fs documentation \nLesson 3: Importing Your Own Files \nPutting all your code in a single file makes it easy to get started with Node.js. As you add \nmore code, you’ll want to stay organized and break your Node.js app into multiple scripts \nthat all work together. In this lesson, you’ll learn how to create a Node.js application that’s \nspread out across multiple files. \nImporting Your Own Files \nYou know how to use require to load in built-in modules. require can also be used to \nload in JavaScript files you’ve created. All you need to do is provide require with a \nrelative path to the script you want to load. This path should start with ./ and then link to \nthe file that needs to be loaded in. \nconst checkUtils = require('./src/utils.js') \n \ncheckUtils() \nThe code above uses require to load in a file called utils.js in the src directory.

That means the require call above will cause \nutils.js to run. Node.js provides the required script with a place to store values that \nshould be exported as part of the library. This is on module.exports. \nYou can see utils.js below. A function is defined and then assigned to module.exports. \nThe value stored on module.exports will be the return value for require when the script is \nimported. That means other scripts could load in the utilities to access the check function. \nconst check = function () { \n    console.log('Doing some work...') \n} \n \nmodule.exports = check \nIf you run the original script, you’ll see the message that logged from the check function in \nutils.js.","metadata":{"_id":"68ae1699bb00e5fd2c951775","source":"api"}}],["c3c59095-22df-4f96-8025-5720b47d4c2c",{"pageContent":"Version 1.0 \n12 \n$ node app.js \nDoing some work... \nYour Node.js scripts don’t share a global score. This means variables created in one \nscripts are not accessible in a different script. The only way to share values between \nscripts is by using require with module.exports. \nLesson 4: Importing npm Modules \nWhen you install Node.js, you also get npm. npm is a package manager that allows you to \ninstall and use third-party npm libraries in your code. This opens up a world of possibilities, \nas there are npm packages for everything from email sending to file uploading. In this \nlesson, you’ll learn how to integrate npm into your Node.js app. \nInitializing npm \nYour Node.js application needs to initialize npm before npm can be used. You can run npm \ninit from the root of your project to get that done. That command will ask you a series of \nquestions about the project and it’ll use the information to generate a package.json file in \nthe root of your project. \nHere’s an example. \n{","metadata":{"_id":"68ae1699bb00e5fd2c951775","source":"api"}}],["8037135c-9568-4412-b49a-b274fde5c6ca",{"pageContent":"questions about the project and it’ll use the information to generate a package.json file in \nthe root of your project. \nHere’s an example. \n{ \n  \"name\": \"notes-app\", \n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \n  \"description\": \"\", \n  \"main\": \"app.js\", \n  \"scripts\": { \n    \"test\": \"echo \\\"Error: no test specified\\\" && exit 1\" \n  }, \n  \"author\": \"\", \n  \"license\": \"ISC\", \n} \nInstalling an npm Module \nYou’re now ready to install an npm module.

This allows you to track and manage the module you have installed. \nThird, npm creates a package-lock.json file. This includes detailed information about the \nmodules you’ve installed which helps keep things fast and secure. \nYou should never make changes to node_modules or package-lock.json.

The first is JSON.stringify and \nthe second is JSON.parse. JSON.stringify converts a JavaScript object into a JSON \nstring, while JSON.parse converts a JSON string into a JavaScript object. \nconst book = { \n  title: 'Ego is the Enemy', \n  author: 'Ryan Holiday' \n} \n \n// Covert JavaScript object into JSON string \nconst bookJSON = JSON.stringify(book) \n \n// Covert JSON string into object \nconst bookObject = JSON.parse(bookJSON) \nconsole.log(bookObject.title) // Print: Ego is the Enemy \nJSON looks similar to a JavaScript object, but there are some differences.

Arrow functions come with a \nfew great features, making them a nice alternative to the standard ES5 function. You’ll \nexplore the new syntax and learn when to use them! \nArrow Functions \nArrow functions offer up an alternative syntax from the standard ES5 function. The snippet \nbelow shows an example of a standard function and then an arrow function. While the \nsyntax is obviously different, you still have the two important pieces, an arguments list and \na function body. \n// const square function (x) { \n//     return x * x \n// } \n \nconst square = (x) => { \n    return x * x \n} \n \nconsole.log(square(2))    // Will print: 4 \nShorthand Syntax","metadata":{"_id":"68ae1699bb00e5fd2c951775","source":"api"}}],["1bf348b0-6d9c-41ad-98e3-2807837f8c4c",{"pageContent":"a function body. \n// const square function (x) { \n//     return x * x \n// } \n \nconst square = (x) => { \n    return x * x \n} \n \nconsole.log(square(2))    // Will print: 4 \nShorthand Syntax \nArrow functions have an optional shorthand syntax. This is useful when you have a \nfunction that immediately returns a value. The example below shows how this can be \nused. \nconst squareAlt = (x) => x * x \n \n \nconsole.log(squareAlt(2)) // Will print: 4 \nNotice that two important things are missing from the function definition. First, the curly \nbraces wrapping the function body have been removed as well as the return statement. \nIn place of both is the value to be returned.

Instead, the this value of the scope in \nwhich it was defined is accessible. This makes arrow functions bad candidates for \nmethods, as this won’t be a reference to the object the method is defined on. \nFor methods, ES6 provides a new method definition syntax. You can see this in the \ndefinition of the printGuestList method below. That function is a standard function, just \nwith a shorthand syntax which allows for the removal of the colon and the function \nkeyword. \nBecause arrow functions don’t bind this, they work well for everything except methods. As \nshown below, the arrow function passed to forEach is able to access this.name correctly, \nas it’s defined as an arrow function and doesn’t have a this binding of its own.

It \nprovides a shortcut for defining a property whose value comes from a variable of the same \nname. You can see this in the example below where a user object is created. The name \nproperty gets its value from a variable also called name.","metadata":{"_id":"68ae1699bb00e5fd2c951775","source":"api"}}],["0b7c2b36-2be2-4569-beee-896f7179cb61",{"pageContent":"Version 1.0 \n35 \nconst name = 'Andrew' \nconst userAge = 27 \n \nconst user = { \n    name: name, \n    age: userAge, \n    location: 'Philadelphia' \n} \nThe shorthand allows you to remove the colon and the reference to the variable.

Object destructuring gives you a syntax \nfor pulling properties off of objects and into standalone variables. This is useful when \nworking with the same object properties throughout your code. Instead of writing \nuser.name a dozen times, you could destructure the property into a name variable. \nYou can see an example of this below.","metadata":{"_id":"68ae1699bb00e5fd2c951775","source":"api"}}],["ee9ac995-cdef-4872-8c05-8ea3613fbe75",{"pageContent":"Version 1.0 \n36 \nconst user = { \n  name: 'Andrew', \n  age: 27, \n  location: 'Philadelphia' \n} \n \n// The line below uses destructuring \nconst { age, location:address } = user \n \nconsole.log(age) \nconsole.log(address) \nuser is destructured on line 8 above.

Events allow you to \ntransfer data from the client to the server or from the server to the client. \nWorking with Events \nThere are two sides to every event, the sender and the receiver. If the server is the \nsender, then the client is the receiver. If the client is the sender, then the server is the \nreceiver. \nEvents can be sent from the sender using emit. Events can be received by the receiver \nusing on. The example below shows how this pattern can be used to create a simple \ncounter application. The following snippet contains the client-side JavaScript code. \nconst socket = io() \n \n// Listen for \"countUpdated\" \nsocket.on('countUpdated', (count) => { \n    console.log('The count has been updated!', count) \n}) \n \ndocument.querySelector('#increment').addEventListener('click', () => { \n    // Emit \"increment","metadata":{"_id":"68ae1699bb00e5fd2c951775","source":"api"}}],["e65c2196-d0a1-4fc1-9982-e4e997da0099",{"pageContent":"socket.on('countUpdated', (count) => { \n    console.log('The count has been updated!', count) \n}) \n \ndocument.querySelector('#increment').addEventListener('click', () => { \n    // Emit \"increment \n    socket.emit('increment') \n}) \nThe client-side code uses on to listen for the countUpdated event. A message will be \nlogged with the current count when that event is received. The client-side code also uses \nemit to send the increment event. This occurs when a button on the screen is clicked. \nThe server-side code for this example is below.","metadata":{"_id":"68ae1699bb00e5fd2c951775","source":"api"}}],["4b347831-9c1d-47d6-80a0-6c0ce0df1100",{"pageContent":"Version 1.0 \n112 \nlet count = 0 \n \nio.on('connection', (socket) => { \n    console.log('New WebSocket connection') \n \n    socket.emit('countUpdated', count) \n \n    socket.on('increment', () => { \n        count++ \n        io.emit('countUpdated', count) \n    }) \n}) \nThe server above is responsible for emitting countUpdated and listening for increment. \nNew users get the current count right after they connect to the server. If a client sends \nincrement to the server, the count is incremented and all connected clients are notified of \nthe change. \nOn the client, socket.emit emits an event to the server. On the server, both socket.emit \nand io.emit can be used. socket.emit sends an event to that specific client, while \nio.emit sends an event to all connected clients. \nLesson 6: Socket.io Events Challenge \nIn this lesson, it’s on you to use events to build the chat applications messaging system. \nThere are no notes for this challenge video, as no new information is covered.

Broadcasted events are sent to all \nconnected clients, expect for the client that initiated the broadcast. \nBroadcasting Events \nEvents can be broadcasted from the server using socket.broadcast.emit. This event will \nget sent to all sockets except the one that broadcasted the event. The code below shows \nthis off.

Once the \nuser gives you permission to access their location, this location can be shared with \neveryone else in the chat room. The code below attempts to share a user’s location with \nthe chat room. \ndocument.querySelector('#send-location').addEventListener('click', () => { \n    if (!navigator.geolocation) { \n        return alert('Geolocation is not supported by your browser.') \n    } \n \n    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition((position) => { \n        socket.emit('sendLocation', { \n            latitude: position.coords.latitude, \n            longitude: position.coords.longitude \n        })","metadata":{"_id":"68ae1699bb00e5fd2c951775","source":"api"}}],["d0db4725-5a74-4138-962e-baccc2b6627f",{"pageContent":"socket.emit('sendLocation', { \n            latitude: position.coords.latitude, \n            longitude: position.coords.longitude \n        }) \n    }) \n}) \nFirst up, check if navigator.geolocation exists. This will determine if the browser \nsupports geolocation. From there, navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition can be \ncalled to fetch the user’s location. The provided callback function will get called with the \nuser’s position, which includes the latitude and longitude. \nWith the client set up, the server can listen for the sendLocation event.

This allows the receiver of an \nevent to send a message back to the sender of the event. This is useful for error handling \nand data validation. \nEvent Acknowledgements \nTo explore acknowledgements, let’s set up the server to screen messages for profane \nlanguage. The bad-words module will let you check text for profane language. \nnpm i bad-words@3.0.0 \nYou already know there are two sides to every event, the sender and the receiver. In the \nexample below, the client is the one emitting the sendMessage event. The big change is \nthe addition of the callback function. This function will run if/when the server \nacknowledges the event. \nsocket.emit('sendMessage', message, (error) => {","metadata":{"_id":"68ae1699bb00e5fd2c951775","source":"api"}}],["7b210b7f-6be9-415f-a5bc-40c825f2f6b4",{"pageContent":"the addition of the callback function.

Aside from the \nmessage parameter, it now has access to the callback parameter.

This form should be disabled \nwhile messages are being sent to the server. This will prevent duplicate messages from \nbeing sent if the user was to double-click the button.

In this lesson, you’ll be creating and running your very first Node.js app. \nCreating a Script \nNode.js scripts are created with the js file extension. Remember that Node.js is not a \nprogramming language. All the code in this course is JavaScript code, which is why the js \nextension is used. \nBelow is an example script stored in a file named index.js. \nconsole.log('Hello Node.js!') \nRunning a Script","metadata":{"_id":"68aea2c5fbe495949fe41bac"}}],["ae928f31-443a-4d3f-ab8b-94bab4edfff1",{"pageContent":"extension is used. \nBelow is an example script stored in a file named index.js. \nconsole.log('Hello Node.js!') \nRunning a Script \nYou can run a Node.js script using the node command.

The module \nsystem lets you load external libraries into your application. That’ll enable you to take \nadvantage of built-in Node.js modules as well as third-party npm modules. This includes \nlibraries for connecting to database, creating web servers, and more! \nLesson 2: Importing Node.js Core Modules \nNode.js comes with dozens of built-in modules. These built-in modules, sometimes \nreferred to as core modules, give you access to tools for working with the file system, \nmaking http requests, creating web servers, and more! In this lesson, you’ll learn how to \nload in those core modules and use them in your code. \nImporting Node.js Core Modules \nTo get started, let’s work with some built-in Node.js modules. These are modules that \ncome with Node, so there’s no need to install them.","metadata":{"_id":"68aea2c5fbe495949fe41bac"}}],["c63cef63-fdc4-438a-9465-aecd303afcf6",{"pageContent":"Importing Node.js Core Modules \nTo get started, let’s work with some built-in Node.js modules. These are modules that \ncome with Node, so there’s no need to install them. \nThe module system is built around the require function. This function is used to load in a \nmodule and get access to its contents. require is a global variable provided to all your \nNode.js scripts, so you can use it anywhere you like! \nLet’s look at an example. \nconst fs = require('fs') \n  \nfs.writeFileSync('notes.txt', 'I live in Philadelphia') \nThe script above uses require to load in the fs module. This is a built-in Node.js module \nthat provides functions you can use to manipulate the file system. The script uses \nwriteFileSync to write a message to notes.txt. \nAfter you run the script, you’ll notice a new notes.txt file in your directory. Open it up and \nyou’ll see, “I live in Philadelphia!”. \nLinks \n• Node.js documentation","metadata":{"_id":"68aea2c5fbe495949fe41bac"}}],["fdee49f0-6277-48d6-9b66-222b19d76bea",{"pageContent":"Version 1.0 \n11 \n• Node.js fs documentation \nLesson 3: Importing Your Own Files \nPutting all your code in a single file makes it easy to get started with Node.js. As you add \nmore code, you’ll want to stay organized and break your Node.js app into multiple scripts \nthat all work together. In this lesson, you’ll learn how to create a Node.js application that’s \nspread out across multiple files. \nImporting Your Own Files \nYou know how to use require to load in built-in modules. require can also be used to \nload in JavaScript files you’ve created. All you need to do is provide require with a \nrelative path to the script you want to load. This path should start with ./ and then link to \nthe file that needs to be loaded in. \nconst checkUtils = require('./src/utils.js') \n \ncheckUtils() \nThe code above uses require to load in a file called utils.js in the src directory.

That means the require call above will cause \nutils.js to run. Node.js provides the required script with a place to store values that \nshould be exported as part of the library. This is on module.exports. \nYou can see utils.js below. A function is defined and then assigned to module.exports. \nThe value stored on module.exports will be the return value for require when the script is \nimported. That means other scripts could load in the utilities to access the check function. \nconst check = function () { \n    console.log('Doing some work...') \n} \n \nmodule.exports = check \nIf you run the original script, you’ll see the message that logged from the check function in \nutils.js.","metadata":{"_id":"68aea2c5fbe495949fe41bac"}}],["a7f7fec6-7fac-4433-af91-c14fd0d6c7b7",{"pageContent":"Version 1.0 \n12 \n$ node app.js \nDoing some work... \nYour Node.js scripts don’t share a global score. This means variables created in one \nscripts are not accessible in a different script. The only way to share values between \nscripts is by using require with module.exports. \nLesson 4: Importing npm Modules \nWhen you install Node.js, you also get npm. npm is a package manager that allows you to \ninstall and use third-party npm libraries in your code. This opens up a world of possibilities, \nas there are npm packages for everything from email sending to file uploading. In this \nlesson, you’ll learn how to integrate npm into your Node.js app. \nInitializing npm \nYour Node.js application needs to initialize npm before npm can be used. You can run npm \ninit from the root of your project to get that done. That command will ask you a series of \nquestions about the project and it’ll use the information to generate a package.json file in \nthe root of your project. \nHere’s an example. \n{","metadata":{"_id":"68aea2c5fbe495949fe41bac"}}],["0aaca790-fe3f-45ef-8596-69658331449d",{"pageContent":"questions about the project and it’ll use the information to generate a package.json file in \nthe root of your project. \nHere’s an example. \n{ \n  \"name\": \"notes-app\", \n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \n  \"description\": \"\", \n  \"main\": \"app.js\", \n  \"scripts\": { \n    \"test\": \"echo \\\"Error: no test specified\\\" && exit 1\" \n  }, \n  \"author\": \"\", \n  \"license\": \"ISC\", \n} \nInstalling an npm Module \nYou’re now ready to install an npm module.

JSON, which stands for JavaScript \nObject Notation, is a lightweight data format. JSON makes it easy to store or transfer data. \nYou’ll be using it in this application to store users notes in the file system.","metadata":{"_id":"68aea2c5fbe495949fe41bac"}}],["739c6409-1933-47bd-9c2c-afe32ca34782",{"pageContent":"Version 1.0 \n19 \nWorking with JSON \nSince JSON is nothing more than a string, it can be used to store data in a text file or \ntransfer data via an HTTP requests between two machines. \nJavaScript provides two methods for working with JSON. The first is JSON.stringify and \nthe second is JSON.parse. JSON.stringify converts a JavaScript object into a JSON \nstring, while JSON.parse converts a JSON string into a JavaScript object. \nconst book = { \n  title: 'Ego is the Enemy', \n  author: 'Ryan Holiday' \n} \n \n// Covert JavaScript object into JSON string \nconst bookJSON = JSON.stringify(book) \n \n// Covert JSON string into object \nconst bookObject = JSON.parse(bookJSON) \nconsole.log(bookObject.title) // Print: Ego is the Enemy \nJSON looks similar to a JavaScript object, but there are some differences.

Arrow functions come with a \nfew great features, making them a nice alternative to the standard ES5 function. You’ll \nexplore the new syntax and learn when to use them! \nArrow Functions \nArrow functions offer up an alternative syntax from the standard ES5 function. The snippet \nbelow shows an example of a standard function and then an arrow function. While the \nsyntax is obviously different, you still have the two important pieces, an arguments list and \na function body. \n// const square function (x) { \n//     return x * x \n// } \n \nconst square = (x) => { \n    return x * x \n} \n \nconsole.log(square(2))    // Will print: 4 \nShorthand Syntax","metadata":{"_id":"68aea2c5fbe495949fe41bac"}}],["c2694e5e-8b47-418d-95f6-1b1d6644dc64",{"pageContent":"a function body. \n// const square function (x) { \n//     return x * x \n// } \n \nconst square = (x) => { \n    return x * x \n} \n \nconsole.log(square(2))    // Will print: 4 \nShorthand Syntax \nArrow functions have an optional shorthand syntax. This is useful when you have a \nfunction that immediately returns a value. The example below shows how this can be \nused. \nconst squareAlt = (x) => x * x \n \n \nconsole.log(squareAlt(2)) // Will print: 4 \nNotice that two important things are missing from the function definition. First, the curly \nbraces wrapping the function body have been removed as well as the return statement. \nIn place of both is the value to be returned. There’s no need for an explicit return \nstatement, as the value provide is implicitly returned.","metadata":{"_id":"68aea2c5fbe495949fe41bac"}}],["535d3c86-cbdc-4b27-86b3-a3e7ffab6334",{"pageContent":"Version 1.0 \n21 \nThis Binding \nArrow functions don’t bind their own this value. Instead, the this value of the scope in \nwhich it was defined is accessible. This makes arrow functions bad candidates for \nmethods, as this won’t be a reference to the object the method is defined on. \nFor methods, ES6 provides a new method definition syntax. You can see this in the \ndefinition of the printGuestList method below. That function is a standard function, just \nwith a shorthand syntax which allows for the removal of the colon and the function \nkeyword. \nBecause arrow functions don’t bind this, they work well for everything except methods. As \nshown below, the arrow function passed to forEach is able to access this.name correctly, \nas it’s defined as an arrow function and doesn’t have a this binding of its own. That code \nwouldn’t work if you swapped out the arrow function for a standard function. \nconst event = { \n    name: 'Birthday Party', \n    guestList: ['Andrew', 'Jen', 'Mike'],","metadata":{"_id":"68aea2c5fbe495949fe41bac"}}],["fbcfb4d1-753f-4e70-9141-08f08517a056",{"pageContent":"wouldn’t work if you swapped out the arrow function for a standard function. \nconst event = { \n    name: 'Birthday Party', \n    guestList: ['Andrew', 'Jen', 'Mike'], \n    printGuestList() { \n        console.log('Guest list for ' + this.name) \n         \n        this.guestList.forEach((guest) => { \n            console.log(guest + ' is attending ' + this.name) \n        }) \n    } \n} \n \nevent.printGuestList() \nLinks \n• Arrow function \nLesson 9: Refactoring to Use Arrow Functions \nIn this lesson, you’ll use what you’ve learned about arrow functions to integrate them into \nthe Node.js app. \nThere are no notes for this challenge video, as no new information is covered.

In this lesson, you’ll explore a \ncouple of features that make it easier to work with objects. \nProperty Shorthand \nThe property shorthand makes it easier to define properties when creating a new object. It \nprovides a shortcut for defining a property whose value comes from a variable of the same \nname. You can see this in the example below where a user object is created. The name \nproperty gets its value from a variable also called name.","metadata":{"_id":"68aea2c5fbe495949fe41bac"}}],["a7195002-519f-464e-9f1e-6f2d345be608",{"pageContent":"Version 1.0 \n35 \nconst name = 'Andrew' \nconst userAge = 27 \n \nconst user = { \n    name: name, \n    age: userAge, \n    location: 'Philadelphia' \n} \nThe shorthand allows you to remove the colon and the reference to the variable. When \nJavaScript sees this, it’ll get the property value from the variable with the same name. The \nexample below uses the property shorthand to define name on the user object. \nconst name = 'Andrew' \nconst userAge = 27 \n \nconst user = { \n    name, \n    age: userAge, \n    location: 'Philadelphia' \n} \n \nconsole.log(user) \nObject Destructuring \nThe second ES6 feature is object destructuring. Object destructuring gives you a syntax \nfor pulling properties off of objects and into standalone variables. This is useful when \nworking with the same object properties throughout your code. Instead of writing \nuser.name a dozen times, you could destructure the property into a name variable. \nYou can see an example of this below.","metadata":{"_id":"68aea2c5fbe495949fe41bac"}}],["6c9086de-410a-4b3c-8ec0-b949d92da8e8",{"pageContent":"Version 1.0 \n36 \nconst user = { \n  name: 'Andrew', \n  age: 27, \n  location: 'Philadelphia' \n} \n \n// The line below uses destructuring \nconst { age, location:address } = user \n \nconsole.log(age) \nconsole.log(address) \nuser is destructured on line 8 above.

The location property has also been destructured and stored in address. \nDestructuring Function Arguments \nDestructuring works with function parameters as well. If an object is passed into a function, \nit can be destructured inside the function definition. You can see this in the transaction \nfunction below.

MongoDB uses ObjectIDs to create unique \nidentifiers for all the documents in the database. It’s different than the traditional auto-\nincrementing integer ID, but it comes with its own set of advantages. \nWorking with ObjectIDs \nMongoDB provides ObjectID which can be used to generate new ObjectIDs.

GUIDs are generated randomly via an \nalgorithm to ensure uniqueness. These IDs can be generated on the server, but as seen in \nthe snippet above, they can be generated on the client as well. That means a client can \ngenerate the ID for a document it’s about to insert in to the database. \nLesson 9: Querying Documents","metadata":{"_id":"68aea2c5fbe495949fe41bac"}}],["12ce289c-648e-48c0-84c1-55da56458c78",{"pageContent":"the snippet above, they can be generated on the client as well.

Promise chaining is a syntax that allows you \nto chain together multiple asynchronous tasks in a specific order. This is great for complex \ncode where one asynchronous task needs to be performed after the completion of a \ndifferent asynchronous task. \nPromise Chaining \nTo demonstrate promise chaining, the following function will be used to simulate an \nasynchronous task. In reality, it’s just adding up a couple of numbers, waiting two seconds, \nand fulfilling the promise with the sum. \nconst add = (a, b) => { \n    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => { \n        setTimeout(() => { \n            if (a < 0 || b < 0) { \n                return reject('Numbers must be non-negative') \n            } \n \n            resolve(a + b) \n        }, 2000) \n    }) \n} \nWith the dummy asynchronous function defined, promise chaining can be used to call add","metadata":{"_id":"68aea2c5fbe495949fe41bac"}}],["c43aa251-af1a-4a80-a6d7-3defe258c016",{"pageContent":"} \n \n            resolve(a + b) \n        }, 2000) \n    }) \n} \nWith the dummy asynchronous function defined, promise chaining can be used to call add \ntwice. The code below adds up 1 and 2 for a total of 3. It then uses the sum of 3 as the \ninput for another call to add. The second call to add adds up 3 and 4 for a total of 7. \nPromise chaining occurs when the then callback function returns a promise.

If the server is the \nsender, then the client is the receiver. If the client is the sender, then the server is the \nreceiver. \nEvents can be sent from the sender using emit. Events can be received by the receiver \nusing on. The example below shows how this pattern can be used to create a simple \ncounter application. The following snippet contains the client-side JavaScript code. \nconst socket = io() \n \n// Listen for \"countUpdated\" \nsocket.on('countUpdated', (count) => { \n    console.log('The count has been updated!', count) \n}) \n \ndocument.querySelector('#increment').addEventListener('click', () => { \n    // Emit \"increment","metadata":{"_id":"68aea2c5fbe495949fe41bac"}}],["4cb55408-8cf6-4c57-80b2-14e1162b5035",{"pageContent":"socket.on('countUpdated', (count) => { \n    console.log('The count has been updated!', count) \n}) \n \ndocument.querySelector('#increment').addEventListener('click', () => { \n    // Emit \"increment \n    socket.emit('increment') \n}) \nThe client-side code uses on to listen for the countUpdated event. A message will be \nlogged with the current count when that event is received. The client-side code also uses \nemit to send the increment event.

If a client sends \nincrement to the server, the count is incremented and all connected clients are notified of \nthe change. \nOn the client, socket.emit emits an event to the server. On the server, both socket.emit \nand io.emit can be used. socket.emit sends an event to that specific client, while \nio.emit sends an event to all connected clients. \nLesson 6: Socket.io Events Challenge \nIn this lesson, it’s on you to use events to build the chat applications messaging system. \nThere are no notes for this challenge video, as no new information is covered.

Once the \nuser gives you permission to access their location, this location can be shared with \neveryone else in the chat room. The code below attempts to share a user’s location with \nthe chat room. \ndocument.querySelector('#send-location').addEventListener('click', () => { \n    if (!navigator.geolocation) { \n        return alert('Geolocation is not supported by your browser.') \n    } \n \n    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition((position) => { \n        socket.emit('sendLocation', { \n            latitude: position.coords.latitude, \n            longitude: position.coords.longitude \n        })","metadata":{"_id":"68aea2c5fbe495949fe41bac"}}],["d1fc0fc6-8a34-4ec1-a500-c96defc3333d",{"pageContent":"socket.emit('sendLocation', { \n            latitude: position.coords.latitude, \n            longitude: position.coords.longitude \n        }) \n    }) \n}) \nFirst up, check if navigator.geolocation exists. This will determine if the browser \nsupports geolocation. From there, navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition can be \ncalled to fetch the user’s location. The provided callback function will get called with the \nuser’s position, which includes the latitude and longitude. \nWith the client set up, the server can listen for the sendLocation event. When it’s received, \nio.emit is used to share that location with everyone in the chat room","metadata":{"_id":"68aea2c5fbe495949fe41bac"}}],["5a30b162-7f08-47e7-8be9-9dd48afa41c7",{"pageContent":"Version 1.0 \n114 \nsocket.on('sendLocation', (coords) => { \n    io.emit('message', \n`https://google.com/maps?q=${coords.latitude},${coords.longitude}`) \n}) \nDocumentation Links \n• MDN: Geolocation API \nLesson 9: Event Acknowledgements \nIn this lesson, you’ll learn about event acknowledgements. This allows the receiver of an \nevent to send a message back to the sender of the event. This is useful for error handling \nand data validation. \nEvent Acknowledgements \nTo explore acknowledgements, let’s set up the server to screen messages for profane \nlanguage. The bad-words module will let you check text for profane language. \nnpm i bad-words@3.0.0 \nYou already know there are two sides to every event, the sender and the receiver. In the \nexample below, the client is the one emitting the sendMessage event. The big change is \nthe addition of the callback function. This function will run if/when the server \nacknowledges the event. \nsocket.emit('sendMessage', message, (error) => {","metadata":{"_id":"68aea2c5fbe495949fe41bac"}}],["f8b04ec9-50ac-4779-a345-0d7ebb23b6f0",{"pageContent":"the addition of the callback function.

Aside from the \nmessage parameter, it now has access to the callback parameter. This callback function \ncan be called on the server to trigger the acknowledgement function on the client. \nThe callback can be called with or without data.

This form should be disabled \nwhile messages are being sent to the server. This will prevent duplicate messages from \nbeing sent if the user was to double-click the button. The form can be disabled by setting \nthe disabled attribute on the submit button. \nconst $messageFormButton = $messageForm.querySelector('button')","metadata":{"_id":"68aea2c5fbe495949fe41bac"}}],["3cfb37e6-aa1f-49d5-b8e5-2b3435fa9e46",{"pageContent":"the disabled attribute on the submit button. \nconst $messageFormButton = $messageForm.querySelector('button') \n \n// Disable button \n$messageFormButton.setAttribute('disabled', 'disabled') \n \n// Enable buttons \n$messageFormButton.removeAttribute('disabled') \nThe interaction with the text input can also be improved.

In this lesson, you’ll be creating and running your very first Node.js app. \nCreating a Script \nNode.js scripts are created with the js file extension. Remember that Node.js is not a \nprogramming language. All the code in this course is JavaScript code, which is why the js \nextension is used. \nBelow is an example script stored in a file named index.js. \nconsole.log('Hello Node.js!') \nRunning a Script","metadata":{"_id":"68aea2dcfbe495949fe41bae"}}],["718f2f54-b384-44ce-8077-4a627c56b14f",{"pageContent":"extension is used. \nBelow is an example script stored in a file named index.js. \nconsole.log('Hello Node.js!') \nRunning a Script \nYou can run a Node.js script using the node command.

The module \nsystem lets you load external libraries into your application. That’ll enable you to take \nadvantage of built-in Node.js modules as well as third-party npm modules. This includes \nlibraries for connecting to database, creating web servers, and more! \nLesson 2: Importing Node.js Core Modules \nNode.js comes with dozens of built-in modules. These built-in modules, sometimes \nreferred to as core modules, give you access to tools for working with the file system, \nmaking http requests, creating web servers, and more! In this lesson, you’ll learn how to \nload in those core modules and use them in your code. \nImporting Node.js Core Modules \nTo get started, let’s work with some built-in Node.js modules. These are modules that \ncome with Node, so there’s no need to install them.","metadata":{"_id":"68aea2dcfbe495949fe41bae"}}],["4b99e927-938d-43ff-90b3-b0e34f54f5c7",{"pageContent":"Importing Node.js Core Modules \nTo get started, let’s work with some built-in Node.js modules. These are modules that \ncome with Node, so there’s no need to install them. \nThe module system is built around the require function. This function is used to load in a \nmodule and get access to its contents. require is a global variable provided to all your \nNode.js scripts, so you can use it anywhere you like! \nLet’s look at an example. \nconst fs = require('fs') \n  \nfs.writeFileSync('notes.txt', 'I live in Philadelphia') \nThe script above uses require to load in the fs module. This is a built-in Node.js module \nthat provides functions you can use to manipulate the file system. The script uses \nwriteFileSync to write a message to notes.txt. \nAfter you run the script, you’ll notice a new notes.txt file in your directory. Open it up and \nyou’ll see, “I live in Philadelphia!”. \nLinks \n• Node.js documentation","metadata":{"_id":"68aea2dcfbe495949fe41bae"}}],["d61041c7-542a-4758-8a90-1e2f62464481",{"pageContent":"Version 1.0 \n11 \n• Node.js fs documentation \nLesson 3: Importing Your Own Files \nPutting all your code in a single file makes it easy to get started with Node.js. As you add \nmore code, you’ll want to stay organized and break your Node.js app into multiple scripts \nthat all work together. In this lesson, you’ll learn how to create a Node.js application that’s \nspread out across multiple files. \nImporting Your Own Files \nYou know how to use require to load in built-in modules. require can also be used to \nload in JavaScript files you’ve created. All you need to do is provide require with a \nrelative path to the script you want to load. This path should start with ./ and then link to \nthe file that needs to be loaded in. \nconst checkUtils = require('./src/utils.js') \n \ncheckUtils() \nThe code above uses require to load in a file called utils.js in the src directory.

That means the require call above will cause \nutils.js to run. Node.js provides the required script with a place to store values that \nshould be exported as part of the library. This is on module.exports. \nYou can see utils.js below. A function is defined and then assigned to module.exports. \nThe value stored on module.exports will be the return value for require when the script is \nimported. That means other scripts could load in the utilities to access the check function. \nconst check = function () { \n    console.log('Doing some work...') \n} \n \nmodule.exports = check \nIf you run the original script, you’ll see the message that logged from the check function in \nutils.js.","metadata":{"_id":"68aea2dcfbe495949fe41bae"}}],["f5d7ed0a-4a9d-4e33-bfc4-1f42002624b6",{"pageContent":"Version 1.0 \n12 \n$ node app.js \nDoing some work... \nYour Node.js scripts don’t share a global score. This means variables created in one \nscripts are not accessible in a different script. The only way to share values between \nscripts is by using require with module.exports. \nLesson 4: Importing npm Modules \nWhen you install Node.js, you also get npm. npm is a package manager that allows you to \ninstall and use third-party npm libraries in your code. This opens up a world of possibilities, \nas there are npm packages for everything from email sending to file uploading. In this \nlesson, you’ll learn how to integrate npm into your Node.js app. \nInitializing npm \nYour Node.js application needs to initialize npm before npm can be used. You can run npm \ninit from the root of your project to get that done. That command will ask you a series of \nquestions about the project and it’ll use the information to generate a package.json file in \nthe root of your project. \nHere’s an example. \n{","metadata":{"_id":"68aea2dcfbe495949fe41bae"}}],["ec43f112-67c5-4880-b75d-a217f5268cc9",{"pageContent":"questions about the project and it’ll use the information to generate a package.json file in \nthe root of your project. \nHere’s an example. \n{ \n  \"name\": \"notes-app\", \n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \n  \"description\": \"\", \n  \"main\": \"app.js\", \n  \"scripts\": { \n    \"test\": \"echo \\\"Error: no test specified\\\" && exit 1\" \n  }, \n  \"author\": \"\", \n  \"license\": \"ISC\", \n} \nInstalling an npm Module \nYou’re now ready to install an npm module.

In this lesson, you’ll explore a \ncouple of features that make it easier to work with objects. \nProperty Shorthand \nThe property shorthand makes it easier to define properties when creating a new object. It \nprovides a shortcut for defining a property whose value comes from a variable of the same \nname. You can see this in the example below where a user object is created. The name \nproperty gets its value from a variable also called name.","metadata":{"_id":"68aea2dcfbe495949fe41bae"}}],["f3fcf081-0b09-496e-b87f-0dd5628f6148",{"pageContent":"Version 1.0 \n35 \nconst name = 'Andrew' \nconst userAge = 27 \n \nconst user = { \n    name: name, \n    age: userAge, \n    location: 'Philadelphia' \n} \nThe shorthand allows you to remove the colon and the reference to the variable. When \nJavaScript sees this, it’ll get the property value from the variable with the same name. The \nexample below uses the property shorthand to define name on the user object. \nconst name = 'Andrew' \nconst userAge = 27 \n \nconst user = { \n    name, \n    age: userAge, \n    location: 'Philadelphia' \n} \n \nconsole.log(user) \nObject Destructuring \nThe second ES6 feature is object destructuring. Object destructuring gives you a syntax \nfor pulling properties off of objects and into standalone variables. This is useful when \nworking with the same object properties throughout your code. Instead of writing \nuser.name a dozen times, you could destructure the property into a name variable. \nYou can see an example of this below.","metadata":{"_id":"68aea2dcfbe495949fe41bae"}}],["75e32471-84ec-41a6-8a97-7f84e61ed2c7",{"pageContent":"Version 1.0 \n36 \nconst user = { \n  name: 'Andrew', \n  age: 27, \n  location: 'Philadelphia' \n} \n \n// The line below uses destructuring \nconst { age, location:address } = user \n \nconsole.log(age) \nconsole.log(address) \nuser is destructured on line 8 above. The age property has been destructured and stored \nin age. The location property has also been destructured and stored in address. \nDestructuring Function Arguments \nDestructuring works with function parameters as well. If an object is passed into a function, \nit can be destructured inside the function definition. You can see this in the transaction \nfunction below. The function accepts an object as its second argument. The label and \nstock properties have both been destructured into standalone variables that become \navailable in the function. \nconst product = { \n    label: 'Red notebook', \n    price: 3, \n    stock: 201, \n    salePrice: undefined, \n    rating: 4.2 \n} \n \nconst transaction = (type, { label, stock }) => {","metadata":{"_id":"68aea2dcfbe495949fe41bae"}}],["a069255f-170b-4835-92a9-276ea30cb6ec",{"pageContent":"const product = { \n    label: 'Red notebook', \n    price: 3, \n    stock: 201, \n    salePrice: undefined, \n    rating: 4.2 \n} \n \nconst transaction = (type, { label, stock }) => { \n    console.log(type, label, stock) \n} \n \ntransaction('order', product) \nLinks \n• Destructuring \n• Property shorthand","metadata":{"_id":"68aea2dcfbe495949fe41bae"}}],["87dd9470-063a-4e53-bbed-83115fa7d602",{"pageContent":"Version 1.0 \n37 \nLesson 13: Destructuring and Property Shorthand Challenge \nIn this video, it’s on you to use the property shorthand and object destructuring syntax in \nyour Node.js app. \nThere are no notes for this challenge video, as no new information is covered.

In this bonus lesson, you’ll learn how to make an HTTP request without \nrequest. \nThe HTTPS Module \nNode.js provides two core modules for making HTTP requests. The http module can be \nused to make http requests and the https module can be used to make https requests. \nOne great feature about request is that it provides a single module that can make both \nhttp and https requests. \nThe code below uses the https module to fetch the forecast from the Dark Sky API.

You can pick any database name that you like. \nconst mongodb = require('mongodb') \nconst MongoClient = mongodb.MongoClient \n \nconst connectionURL = 'mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017' \nconst databaseName = 'task-manager'","metadata":{"_id":"68aea2dcfbe495949fe41bae"}}],["716f0281-6bdd-4132-81bb-201f8c7d20d0",{"pageContent":"const mongodb = require('mongodb') \nconst MongoClient = mongodb.MongoClient \n \nconst connectionURL = 'mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017' \nconst databaseName = 'task-manager' \n \nMongoClient.connect(connectionURL, { useNewUrlParser: true }, (error, client) \n=> { \n    if (error) { \n        return console.log('Unable to connect to database!') \n    } \n \n    const db = client.db(databaseName) \n     \n    // Start to interact with the database \n}) \nInserting a Document \nWith the connection open, you’re ready to insert documents into the database.

You can also \nuse insertMany to insert multiple documents at once. The example below inserts two \ndocuments into “tasks” collection. insertMany expects an array of objects, an array of the \ndocuments you want to insert. \ndb.collection('tasks').insertMany([ \n    { \n        description: 'Clean the house', \n        completed: true \n    },{ \n        description: 'Renew inspection', \n        completed: false \n    } \n], (error, result) => { \n    if (error) {","metadata":{"_id":"68aea2dcfbe495949fe41bae"}}],["a5a54336-f9b9-4be2-9444-0cec06c46814",{"pageContent":"{ \n        description: 'Clean the house', \n        completed: true \n    },{ \n        description: 'Renew inspection', \n        completed: false \n    } \n], (error, result) => { \n    if (error) { \n        return console.log('Unable to insert tasks!') \n    } \n \n    console.log(result.ops) \n}) \nDocumentation Links \n• insertOne","metadata":{"_id":"68aea2dcfbe495949fe41bae"}}],["95192cef-7305-4f24-8ae9-e4ea79c21b85",{"pageContent":"Version 1.0 \n62 \n• insertMany \nLesson 8: The ObjectID \nIn this lesson, you’ll learn about ObjectIDs. MongoDB uses ObjectIDs to create unique \nidentifiers for all the documents in the database. It’s different than the traditional auto-\nincrementing integer ID, but it comes with its own set of advantages. \nWorking with ObjectIDs \nMongoDB provides ObjectID which can be used to generate new ObjectIDs. The \nexample below generates a new ID and prints it to the console. \nconst { MongoClient, ObjectID } = require('mongodb') \nconst id = new ObjectID() \nconsole.log(id) // Print new id to the console  \nAn ObjectID is a GUID (Globally Unique Identifier). GUIDs are generated randomly via an \nalgorithm to ensure uniqueness. These IDs can be generated on the server, but as seen in \nthe snippet above, they can be generated on the client as well. That means a client can \ngenerate the ID for a document it’s about to insert in to the database. \nLesson 9: Querying Documents","metadata":{"_id":"68aea2dcfbe495949fe41bae"}}],["e09e8ab1-1656-4dd3-a253-74d4315d3762",{"pageContent":"the snippet above, they can be generated on the client as well.

Events allow you to \ntransfer data from the client to the server or from the server to the client. \nWorking with Events \nThere are two sides to every event, the sender and the receiver. If the server is the \nsender, then the client is the receiver. If the client is the sender, then the server is the \nreceiver. \nEvents can be sent from the sender using emit. Events can be received by the receiver \nusing on. The example below shows how this pattern can be used to create a simple \ncounter application. The following snippet contains the client-side JavaScript code. \nconst socket = io() \n \n// Listen for \"countUpdated\" \nsocket.on('countUpdated', (count) => { \n    console.log('The count has been updated!', count) \n}) \n \ndocument.querySelector('#increment').addEventListener('click', () => { \n    // Emit \"increment","metadata":{"_id":"68aea2dcfbe495949fe41bae"}}],["becfc64e-3f53-4a37-9473-f1d59b02103d",{"pageContent":"socket.on('countUpdated', (count) => { \n    console.log('The count has been updated!', count) \n}) \n \ndocument.querySelector('#increment').addEventListener('click', () => { \n    // Emit \"increment \n    socket.emit('increment') \n}) \nThe client-side code uses on to listen for the countUpdated event. A message will be \nlogged with the current count when that event is received. The client-side code also uses \nemit to send the increment event. This occurs when a button on the screen is clicked. \nThe server-side code for this example is below.","metadata":{"_id":"68aea2dcfbe495949fe41bae"}}],["46d72d80-ddf9-4fe8-99f2-30ac213f4adc",{"pageContent":"Version 1.0 \n112 \nlet count = 0 \n \nio.on('connection', (socket) => { \n    console.log('New WebSocket connection') \n \n    socket.emit('countUpdated', count) \n \n    socket.on('increment', () => { \n        count++ \n        io.emit('countUpdated', count) \n    }) \n}) \nThe server above is responsible for emitting countUpdated and listening for increment. \nNew users get the current count right after they connect to the server. If a client sends \nincrement to the server, the count is incremented and all connected clients are notified of \nthe change. \nOn the client, socket.emit emits an event to the server. On the server, both socket.emit \nand io.emit can be used. socket.emit sends an event to that specific client, while \nio.emit sends an event to all connected clients. \nLesson 6: Socket.io Events Challenge \nIn this lesson, it’s on you to use events to build the chat applications messaging system. \nThere are no notes for this challenge video, as no new information is covered.

Once the \nuser gives you permission to access their location, this location can be shared with \neveryone else in the chat room. The code below attempts to share a user’s location with \nthe chat room. \ndocument.querySelector('#send-location').addEventListener('click', () => { \n    if (!navigator.geolocation) { \n        return alert('Geolocation is not supported by your browser.') \n    } \n \n    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition((position) => { \n        socket.emit('sendLocation', { \n            latitude: position.coords.latitude, \n            longitude: position.coords.longitude \n        })","metadata":{"_id":"68aea2dcfbe495949fe41bae"}}],["cbc2b283-8e8c-4645-ac95-b02740a2426d",{"pageContent":"socket.emit('sendLocation', { \n            latitude: position.coords.latitude, \n            longitude: position.coords.longitude \n        }) \n    }) \n}) \nFirst up, check if navigator.geolocation exists.

The provided callback function will get called with the \nuser’s position, which includes the latitude and longitude. \nWith the client set up, the server can listen for the sendLocation event.

This allows the receiver of an \nevent to send a message back to the sender of the event. This is useful for error handling \nand data validation. \nEvent Acknowledgements \nTo explore acknowledgements, let’s set up the server to screen messages for profane \nlanguage. The bad-words module will let you check text for profane language. \nnpm i bad-words@3.0.0 \nYou already know there are two sides to every event, the sender and the receiver.

This timestamp will represent the time \nwhen the server sent the message out to everyone in the chat application. The server will \nbe the one to generate the timestamp, which prevents the client from lying about when a \nmessage was sent. \nA JavaScript timestamp is nothing more than an integer. This integer represents the \nnumber of milliseconds since the Unix Epoch. The Unix Epoch was January 1st, 1970 at \nmidnight, so the timestamp for the current point in time is a pretty big number. \n// The getTime method is used to get the timestamp \nconst timestamp = new Date().getTime() \n \nconsole.log(timestamp) // Will print: 1549481884646 \nOnce the server sends the message and timestamp to the client, the client can format the \ntimestamp before rendering it.

The server can add a user to a \nroom by calling socket.join with the room name.

This will allow the application to track the user, and it’ll also allow the data to be \nvalidated.
